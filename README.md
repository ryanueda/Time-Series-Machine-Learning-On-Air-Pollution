# Time-Series-Machine-Learning-On-Air-Pollution
Applications Of Multiple Machine Learning Time Series Techniques On Air Pollution Dataset


## About The Project
The project aims to make use of various time series analysis techniques in sklearn to decompose and analyse time series data, as well as create forecasts based off historical data. The dataset consists of information regarding the air quality of 4 types of gases, as well as their pollution levels (target variable)

This includes and is not limited to :
- Exploratory Data Analysis & Time Series Decomposition
- Data Preprocessing & Wrangling
- Model Building
- Model Training
- Model Evaluation
- Hyperparameter Tuning
